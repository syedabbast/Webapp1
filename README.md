# Webapp1
This is a WebApp project and instructions are given below. The purpose of this project is to show a novice python developer how to deploy a python-based WebApp using free, cloud-based tools.
1. Create your own repository in github
2. Download `index.py` and from here and upload it into your own repository. 
3. `Index.py` file is your front end page, so you can create streamlit webforms or whatever you want. I have just given you an example.
4. Edit the `requirements.txt` file to list the libraries and versions your project will use. I only used streamlit, so you see streamlit here in requirement file.
5. Sign up for streamlit.io 
6. Click New app" and deploy this app on streamlit.io by completing the form using your own git repository. The Main file path would be `index.py` The app can be accessed via https://share.streamlit.io/ or you can embed it on another website as an HTML iframe

Cheers
