# Webapp1
This is a WebApp project and instructions are given below. The purpose of this project is to show a novice python developer how to deploy a python-based WebApp using free, cloud-based tools.
1. Create your own repository in github
2. Download `index.py` and `Pipfile` from here and upload them into your own repository. 
3. Index.py file is your front end page, so you can create streamlit webforms or whatever you want. I have just gave you example
4. Edit the `requirements.txt` file to list the libraries and versions your project will use. I only used streamlit so you see streamlit here in requirement file.
5. Sign up for streamlit.io and deploy this app on streamlit.io using your own git repository.

Cheers
